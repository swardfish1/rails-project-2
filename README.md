# A Recipe Book for the Ages
This is a recipe book. It displays recipes. Saves paper. Looks...we're working on it.
Uses JavaScript, handlebars, jQuery, and AJAX. Front end of full stack app. Back end uses rails.

The concept of this project was pretty simple: create a site that made recipes. Had a few troubles along the way; things breaking, things fixed, html mysteriously disappearing for no reason, the likes. It was a cool challenge to figure out what was going on, especially with the html disappearing. In the end, I ha a grand plan that I had to shave way down in order to finish it in time. But hopefully for my bonus, I'll be able to fix it up, make it look way better, and add in some more cool features I wanted to add in.

Backend is here: https://github.com/swardfish1/project-2-rails

No unsolved problems, but I definitely want to make it look better in future versions.
